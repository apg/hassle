# Hassle: A stupidly simple game framework

Hassle is composed of two parts, really. One is a dirt simple game engine
that utilizes libsdl for drawing and such.

Twerp is the way to script the thing above. It's a dirt simple Lisp
interpreter, that's hopefully < 1000 lines of C, probably in a single
file and maybe even awkward as hell to use. I mean, this whole thing
is a hassle, right?
